    <h2>HTML History</h2>
    <p>If you look at the source code of this site and the collected notes, you may wonder why I write HTML in a weird mix of old and new.</p>
    <p>I started making web pages at the age of 5, only using Notepad on a Windows XP. The early 2000s featured more limited HTML tags and JavaScript capabilities.</p>
    <p>Also, I didn't really know what CSS was until the next decade. The first time I would actually try to use it was in 2017.</p>
