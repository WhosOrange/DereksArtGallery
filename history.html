    <h2>HTML History</h2>
    <p>If you look at the source code of this site and the collected notes, you may wonder why I write HTML in a weird mix of old and new.</p>
    <p>I started making web pages at the age of 5, only using Notepad on a Windows XP. The early 2000s featured more limited HTML tags and JavaScript capabilities.</p>
    <p>Also, I didn't really know what CSS was until the next decade. The first time I would actually try to use it was in 2017. 
      Until then I would use weird roundabout ways to change color for the page. I learned a lot of these things from my dad.</p>
    <p>I made a lot of litle joke sites for the amusement of my friends during elementary and high school. 
      Some where more ambitious, such as making web sites for musical projects that only last a day. 
      A lot were probably just me trying to make someone laugh with very simple elements. One I can remember is a page that only consisted of a red background with text saying:
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: #ff0000; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px;">
      <b>Hi!</b> My name is Eisenhower.
      <br>I like to <i>EAT!!!!</i>
    </p>
    <p><i>My Windows XP later crashed and took a lot of the data, including the original Eisenhower page, with it back in 2008.</i></p>
    <p>I learned how to really use JavaScript in 2024. However, I have been pretty aware of it's existance and dabbled in 2021. 
      My main Windows 10 laptop is showing its age so my daily driver is a Wi-Fi-less Windows 7 (or a Linux laptop I later began to really use in April 2024). 
      All that to say, how I choose to write mostly features pre-2017 ECMAScript conventions, such as creating classes via functions or using <i>var</i> in place of <i>let</i> or <i>const</i>.
