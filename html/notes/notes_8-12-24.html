    <i>So...</i>my washing machine broken. The lid flew <b>right</b> off.
    <br>
    There is a leak from the cold water knob (not the hose...well anymore). We have to turn the water off. 
    <br>
    Also, my phone broke.

    Since Tuesday, the washing machine has been replaced and the water has been turned back on. 
    However, we are without cold water for washing.
