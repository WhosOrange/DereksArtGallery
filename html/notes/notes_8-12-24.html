    <h3>What's Goin' On?</h3>
    <i>So...</i>my washing machine broken. The lid flew <b>right</b> off.
    <br>
    There is a leak from the cold water knob (not the hose...well anymore). We have to turn the water off. 
    <br>
    Also, my phone broke.

    <h3>How It's Goin'</h3>
    Since Tuesday, the washing machine has been replaced and the water has been turned back on. 
    However, we are without cold water for washing.
    <br>
    I've been working on a special project before the end of August, but things like this happening really hamper things.
  </div>

  <div id="wednesday">
    <h3>Damn.</h3>
    <b>Wednesday: </b> I'm pretty sad these days. If I'm being honest.
    I made a cake in celebration of my departed grandma's birthday, but the day we were to celebrate with our family friends was when the plumbing when haywire.
    My other grandma isn't doing to well either. She has been in the hospital frequently recently. 
    So plans have been made for this next weeking. Here's hoping the hot water doesn't go out either.
    We made the descision to just eat the cake ourselves and bake another for the next time.
    <br>
    I'd like to perk myself up and add something to the page tomorrow. Like, something cool. Here's hoping.
  </div>

  <div id="thursday">
    <b>Thursday:</b> We took my phone to get fixed, but it had to wait over night. 
    The washing machine wouldn't run properly without cold water either. We await the plumber.
  </div>
  
  <div id="friday">
    <b>Thank the Elder Gods it's Friday</b> because I got my phone fixed. The plumber came by, but only gave a 2nd opinion.
