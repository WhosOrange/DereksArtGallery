  <div id="how-I-feel">
    <p>Thus, I feel that the MK eras can be roughly split as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>KLASSIC:</b> MK1, MK2, MK3, UMK3, Trilogy, Mythologies: Sub-Zero, MK4, Gold, Special Forces*</li>
      <li><b>3D Era:</b> Deadly Alliance, Tournament Edition, Deception, Shaolin Monks, Armageddon</li>
      <li><b>NRS:</b> Vs. DC, MK 2011, Mobile, MKX, MK11, MK1 (2023), Onslaught</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Lets unpack:</h3>
    <p><b>Enhanced versions?:</b> 
      UMK3 is a significant update to MK3 and one that when ported often trades off content. 
      Trilogy is a home console exclusive that uses UMK3 as it's base. 
      It's worth mentioning that MK4's GameBoy Color port is based off of MK3's GameBoy port and carries assets from that while featuring original sprites drawn from screenshots.  
      Also it has it's own music, text endings, features FMV fatalities and is the only entry other than MK vs. DC to get a T-rating. 
      Gold is in a similar boat to UMK3, by adding new characters in addition to updating game model quality. 
      Advance is a port of the 16-bit UMK3 versions to GameBoy Advance. 
      Tournament Edition is the sequel to the GBA version of Deadly Alliance, adding content not found in the GBA version or the home systems. 
      Unchained is Deception's port to the PSP. It's real significant changes are the ladder design, adding endurance mode and including 4 characters ported from Deadly Alliance.
      The Komplete Edition of MK9 is a second printing of the game with all of the DLC included. 
      MKXL and UMK11 are the same case with MKX and MK11 after it's 2nd pack of DLC. With these 3 versions, no content from the original is traded off like with UMK3 (i.e. stages and Sheeva). 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>But MK4 has side stepping:</b> The gameplay is largely from UMK3 with the klassic arcade style button layout (HP, LP, HK, LK, Block, Run). 
      It's side stepping is button based and not as fluid as Deadly Alliance. 
      It also lacks features such the Krypt, Konquest and side game modes.
      Unlike later games, Liu Kang is the main hero (as in MK1, MK2, MK3, UMK3 and MKT).
      Plus, it features John Tobias and was released in Arcades along side MK1, MK2, MK3 and UMK3.
    </p>
    <p><b>Special Forces:</b> This is the last game to feature involvement from John Tobias. It can kind of be seen as a transitionary game since it is the first to feature a fully explorable 3D environment.</p>
    <p><b>Vs. DC:</b> This is the first game to be published by Warner Bros. (earlier Midway games would later be re-released or reprinted by them). 
      This is first game to feature a story mode, use the Unreal Engine, use professional voice work, have guest fighters and ditch fighting style branching. 
      It was also planned to feature DLC but that was scrapped. It was the first game to be on Playstation 3 and X-Box 360 with MK9 later joining.
      A lot of the art direction and even full assets from this game would later be reused in MK's self-titled reboot in 2011. 
      While there is also fluid 3D sidestepping and Midway attached, I feel that Vs. DC fits in more with the NRS games.
