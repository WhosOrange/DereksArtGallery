  <h1>The 10 Best Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Characters</h1>

    <h2>Number 10: Hol Horse</h2>

    <p>
      What was once a goofy minor antagonist become an unassuming protagonist in one of the most underated pieces of Jojo's Bizarre 
      Adventure media, Crazy Diamond's Demonic Heartbreak. I love his character progression from Stardust into the Diamond prequel. 
      He has surprisingly great chemistry with the Higashgitas and the team up with Boingo is pretty fun.

    <h2>Number 9: Johnny Joestar</h2>

      Johnny doesn't need to walk to stand proud. He rides a horse. Horses are pretty rad. He also got his stand while in ARIZONA!

    <h2>Number 8: Robert E.O. Speedwagon</h2>

      He never married. He's just like me. Mortal Kombat should've had a cross over game with Jojo's Bizarre Adventure instead of DC, 
      just so I could see this guy interact with one of Kung Lao's ancestors. Like, imagine the crossover appeal. GORO versus WHAMU?! 
      Like if the Pillar won the MK tournament and started to invade outworld? 
      That would be a solid T-rated game and Midway could have pulled it off. You don't need the gore to pull it off, but Jojo probably could have done it, 
      considering the amount of brutality the series has (just Golden Wind alone...). 
      It would also get Capcom to collaborate with their biggest fighting game 
      rival, Midway, which never happened and it hurts my soul to this day. Can you imagine a Poker Kombat minigame with D'arby?

    <h2>Number 7: Jonathan Joestar</h2>
    <br>
    <img class="jojo-portrait" src="https://static.jojowiki.com/images/e/e0/latest/20200524193436/JonathanAfterimages.gif">
    <p>
      Jonathan Joestar such a gentleman it hurts my soul. While more achievable in a more Jojolion style, I find him very aspirationonal 
      and I want to look like him. He makes me want to play rugby.
      While 7 seems low in the list for such a titan of culture, in my mind, 7 is jusy the number 1 but it's luckier.
      And lucky for Jonathan, he never saw his son drink pee. That would be ungentlemanly.
      To all the Dio stans...eat the sun, thots.

    <h2>Number 6: Jean Pierre Polnareff</h2>

    <p>
      C'est le vie, madommouselle. Si vou play, dix nuef. Oui oui, les toilette. Gojira, around the world, daftendirekt. I am ley francios.
      He's pretty cool in Tekken (though I prefer Eddie Gordon and Kuzuya Miller myself).

    <h2>Number 5: Okyasu Nijimura</h2>
    <br>
    <img class="jojo-portrait" src="https://static.jojowiki.com/images/0/0a/latest/20191015212947/Okuyasu%27s_new_teeth.png">
    <p>
      OI JOSUKE, I MADE IT TO NUMBER 5 ON THIS LIST! ISN'T THAT WHACKY?
    </p>

    <h2>Number 4: Guido Mista</h2>
    <br>
    <img class="jojo-portrait" src="https://static.jojowiki.com/images/d/d7/latest/20191015213428/Mista_x_4.gif">
    <p>
      Guido Mista is the 4th best character. He is a pretty normal guy with the one exception that he has to 6 stands instead of just one. 
      The stands kick around bullets like its Pro Evolution Soccer, which is pretty rad. I'm glad he made it out alive, he was almost done for.

    <h2>Number 3: Ermes Costello</h2>
    <br>
    <img class="jojo-portrait" src="https://static.jojowiki.com/images/c/c8/latest/20211204152956/KissEffectAnime.gif">
    <p>
      Ermes Costello is the only character in Stone Ocean that doesn't make me cringe. She has the best attitude towards life. 
      She looks like she'd be the seventh member of Korn (note that Korn only had up to 5 members at any given time, with Ray being the 6th).
      Therefore, while Araki may have intended to name her stand, Kiss, to be namd after that one band from the Family Guy Christmas episodes, 
      in my head, she's probably more likely to have named it after the Korn song from their Atticus Ross produced untitled album.
      Besides that, her name is based off of Elvis Costello. While more known to normies as some old classic rock guy, 
      the more cultured of us (those that watched Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me) may recognize him from his collaborations 
      with one Mr. Burt Bacharach, my favorite composer and probably one of the most impactful songwriters of popular music. 
      I love Tex-Mex, so her family's restaraunt would have probably been amazing.

    <h2>Number 2: Josuke Higashgita</h2>
    <br>
    <img class="jojo-portrait" src="https://static.jojowiki.com/images/1/15/latest/20191015215723/Josuke_steals_Joseph%27s_wallet.png">
    <p>
      Josuke Higashgita is a pillar of his community. He loves his family (even when they don't know he exists). He befriends weirdos. 
      He plays Nintendo 64 (making him gamer representation). And on top of it all? Nice hair!
    </p>
    <span style="opacity: 0.2">He should have maried Kakiyoin's cousin after Part 4.</span>

  <div>
    <h2>Number 1: Joeseph Joestar</h2>
    <br>
    <img class="jojo-portrait" src="https://static.jojowiki.com/images/5/50/latest/20200111000551/Joseph_tommy_gun_gif.gif">
    <p>
      How could he not be number one? He sounds just like him. I'm very biased, because I met both of his English voices. 
      I was wearing a Pink Floyd shirt and his older voice started singing "Another Brick In The Wall, Pt.2".
      Joeseph Joestar is also cool because he doesn't need a stand beat ass. Just sunlight power. 
      He begins his part by fighting racism then impregnates a Japanese woman. 
      He's also dad of the year even if he didn't know Josuke existed.
