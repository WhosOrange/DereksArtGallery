    <h2>This is the story of some lost projects!</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="desyH">The iPad EP</h3>
    <p class="desy">
      I borrowed a friend's iPad for the night while staying over. <br> 
      I believe it was for a Korg virtual synthisizer expressly made for the iPad but I could be wrong. 
      I made 7 tracks of music that night, saving them all as PCM wavs. <br> 
      However, the music made on it got deleted by its owner when I declined a roadtrip up to the woods. Boy was that guy angry...and petty.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">Lost Super Early Music</h3>
    <p class="desy">
      Some of my earliest music (for better or worse) ended up getting wiped from my computer following a system restore. <br>
      I'm sad but the loss was probably not that severe. <br>
      Recording primarily consited of me with a FirstAct acoustic guitar or some music concrete made with Adobe Premiere. <br>
      Such classics as "You and Me in the Park", "Plain to Be Me", "Burn The House Right Down" and "I Don't Care"...all <i>gone</i>. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Anyway.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">Video Projects</h3>
    <p class="desy">
      Along with that early music, their music videos were also lost. These included "Fundamentals", "Ur All Alone", "I Don't Care" and others. <br>
      They were (almost) all  Premiere projects. <br>
      With the exception of one which was made using Windows Movie Maker on a Windows Vista. <br>
      One of the more experimental tracks: "War" had an animated music video. <br>
      It was lost from 2008 to 2023 when a family member happened to stumble upon it one day. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Currently at the moment, a sketch like series of videos dubbed "DST" is currently incomplete and spread across different computers. <br>
      In order to get a good chunk of the series, I would have to search for old drives that may not work anymore. <br>
      It went up to 3 whole seasons, a partial movie and an ultimately unfinished 4th season. <br>
      It was a shame because the 4th season had the most amount of effort. <br> 
      They included lots of deliberately written and recorded material, whereas older seasons consits of manipulated home videos or odd animations. <br>
      The 4th season also featured one of my favorite sketches: <b>Scorpion versus the Peanut Butter Jar</b>.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">AM Radio</h3>
    <p class="desy">
      Well, this one didn't last more than a day. <br>
      I consisted of combining two Snap Circuit projects that were shown off in the manual: an AM Radio and an AM Radio Station. <br>
      The sound quality was pretty...quality. Still, my mind was blown when I heard the distorted tunes from the station. <br>
      I wish I had taken a picture of it. Though, it was a project early enough to predate the prevelance of cell phone cameras.
      It was probably one of the coolest things I've done as an elementary school project.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">G.I. Joe</h3>
    <p class="desy">Using a very cheap video camera I got for Christmas and Windows Movie Maker, I made a somewhat serious G.I. Joe something or whatever. It had an evil raccoon.</p>

    <h2>Parts I Wish Were In SSBU</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="desyH">Customized Special Moves</h3>
    <p class="desy">They are cool and can enhance the character for someone who usually dislikes them.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">Jungle Hijinx and multi-layered stages</h3>
    <p class="desy">It's a shame that Jungle Hijinx is the only one. I wished there was more.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">Classic in the vein of the 1st three games</h3>
    <p class="desy">This wager thing is stupid and annoying.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">Twilight Princess Representation</h3>
    <p class="desy">Like just make them alternative skins for the three characters.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">Board The Platforms</h3>
    <p class="desy">This is a PLATFORM fighter after all. Some people just only want to be Lil' Mac players (but for all the characters).</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">Cutscene and Platformer style Adventure Mode</h3>
    <p class="desy">
      Either small like Melee's or a significant change of gameplay like Brawl's. <br>
      World of Light is effectively just lots of Event matches from previous games. The spirit board just duplicates that content. <br>
      Which is a further downgrade from Brawl, because you can replay any event or adventure map anytime you want. Spirit Board takes that away from you in favor of randomness.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">Trophies</h3>
    <p class="desy">
      Or at least add a description to the glorified PNGs. <br>
      They don't even tell you what games they are from. Like, how is little Timmy going to know which Fire Emblem game any given third of the roster is from? <br>
      Such a downgrade. <br>
      <br>
      My ideal solution would be to just have the Stickers be for inanimate objects or stages with all of there info. <br>
      Then, trophies would be more like the Characters mode from N64. <br>
      They bothered rigging some of the trophies in Melee. DLC trophies would be hype.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">Significant Decloning</h3>
    <p class="desy">Why Brawl's roster worked well. A lot of the cuts were clones (Roy, Dr. Mario, Pichu) or overrepresented (Gen 1 Pokemon). They need to give Ganondorf an actual moveset still.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">Character Specific Target Tests</h3>
    <p class="desy">Brawl's greastest weakness is having 5 difficulty based Target Test instead of the previous game's character centered ones. Though, Brawl has the excuse of needing room for Subspace stages. Later games...what's your excuse.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">Adding in the Cut (and sometimes better) Stages</h3>
    <p class="desy">Mute City (Melee), Jungle Hijinx, Pac-Maze, Orbital Gate Assault...bruh, just add the missing stages back in via DLC or update patch. It's not too late. Make Sector Z the secret alternate for of Corneria like the Boxing Ring.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="desyH">Certain original tracks</h3>
    <p class="desy">The "Theme of Solid Snake"'s original MSX recording added a very sweet ambience to Shadow Moses kind of like MGS1's "Cavern". The lack of "Great Sea" or "Midna's Lament" is atrocious.</p>
